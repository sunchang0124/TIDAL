title: Writing a Solid App
---

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with modern Javascript and its ecosystem (e.g. you know how
and when to use tools like npm, Webpack, etc.), know how to write regular Web Apps, and are
interested in building one that reads and writes data to a [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) Pod.

It does not assume any prior knowledge of Semantic Web technologies, Linked Data, RDF, or even 
knowing what those terms mean in the first place!

We'll be building [a note-taking app](https://notepod.vincenttunru.com/) that can add notes to
someone's Pod, and can read existing ones. If you're so inclined, you can [play around with the
source code of the finished
app](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/Vinnl/notepod/tree/5-writing-data/?module=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx)
already.

# Hello, SOLID

Abstract: This repository shows how to build a SOLID application to fetch/create/modify data in your SOLID Pod, start a data request (for research), and participate in researchers' data request. This is my first SOLID application built in a very limited time. I will learn from others and improve it step by step. Welcome to contact me if you have any questions :)

### How does it look like? ###
You can try the [SOLID App](https://sunchang0124.github.io/dist/homepage.html) by yourself. The following functions are implemented in my Solid app so far. You can watch [this video](https://youtu.be/oVFDoKmbpUg) to get the first impression.

You can also jump to the function which you are interested in particular:

2. [Login with your Solid account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVFDoKmbpUg&t=2m21s)
3. [Fetch public data from Solid Pod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVFDoKmbpUg&t=4m19s)
4. [Fetch private data from Solid Pod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVFDoKmbpUg&t=6m52s)
5. [Create new data files to Solid Pod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVFDoKmbpUg&t=8m50s)
6. [Start a data request](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVFDoKmbpUg&t=11m03s)
7. [Provide data to a request from Solid Pod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVFDoKmbpUg&t=17m50s)
8. [Analyze requested data in regular analysis setting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVFDoKmbpUg&t=23m01s)
9. [Participate in a privacy-preserving data request](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVFDoKmbpUg&t=24m44s) 
10. [Analysis in the privacy-preserving data request](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVFDoKmbpUg&t=27m50s)

### Development Updates

**15-06-2020 Update:** Participants grant the requester viewer access automatically when they participate in the data request (by editting the acl file). But in this case, users need to give the application "Control" right when they authorize the application. 

**16-06-2020 Update:** Add valid period option for users when they participate in some data request
